# 🃏 CardStack

**CardStack** is a front-end project where users can create, view, and store dynamic cards through a contact form.  
When a user fills out the form with required fields, the data is saved in the browser’s **localStorage**, and a new **card** automatically appears in the UI.

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, form validation, and data persistence using **JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new cards by filling out a form  
- Data automatically saved in `localStorage`  
- Cards remain even after page reload  
- Clean and responsive UI  
- Option to scroll or reorder cards (Up/Down buttons)  
- Simple, fast, and user-friendly design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User clicks **“Add Card”** to open the form.  
2. All form fields are required — data can’t be submitted empty.  
3. When submitted, data is saved to `localStorage`.  
4. A new card is created dynamically and displayed in the UI.  
5. The next time you open the site, all saved cards automatically appear again.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
